Red Light Green Light policy for container scanning

This repo contains policy files used by Red Light Green Light to
evaluate the results of container scanning.

Containers are scanned during the travis-ci build, and then
periodically thereafter via Ansible playbook.

See https://github.com/atgreen/red-light-green-light for details.
